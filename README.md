# Earthly CI Examples

Each folder contains examples of building [earthly/ci-example-project](https://github.com/earthly/ci-example-project) in a different CI setting, or other CI-adjacent configuration.

These examples are _not_ intended to be production ready, but to serve as showcases of what can be done with `earthly` in CI, and document what configuration may be needed.
